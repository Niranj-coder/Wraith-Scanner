#  WRAITH-SCANNER v1.1

**A surgical network scanner for Android (Termux) that actually works without the error drama!!!**

---

### 🔍 Why I built this:
Nmap on Android usually freezes or throws `SO_ERROR 103` drama. This script bypasses all that with live streaming and automatic logging.

### 🚀 FEATURESSS!!!
* **No Freezing**: Uses subprocess pipes so the terminal doesn't hang.
* **Auto-Log**: Every scan is saved to `/logs` automatically.

### 🏗️ Staging Area:
* **Venom-Vault (v2.0)**: Currently under development......
