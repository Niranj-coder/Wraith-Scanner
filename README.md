WRAITH-SCANNER v1.1
​A surgical network scanner for Android (Termux) that actually works without the error drama!!!
​Why I built this:
​Nmap on Android usually freezes or throws SO_ERROR 103 drama. This script bypasses all that with live streaming and automatic logging.
​FEATURESSS!!!
​No Freezing: Uses subprocess pipes so the terminal doesn't hang.
​Auto-Log: Every scan is saved to /logs automatically.

​Staging Area:
​Venom-Vault (v2.0): Currently under development.......
